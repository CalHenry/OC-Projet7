# Projet7 - Mission - Intégrez et optimisez le système MLOps

## Overview 

This repository contains a comprehensive project focused on building and deploying a credit risk scoring model.  
The project leverages credit risk data from a Kaggle competition as a learning and training exercise.  
The primary components of the project include:

    Scoring Model: A machine learning model designed to predict credit risk based on the provided dataset.
    API Deployment: An API to deploy the scoring model, enabling easy integration and access.
    Streamlit App: A user-friendly Streamlit application that interacts with the API, allowing users to input data and receive credit risk scores.
    MLflow Integration: Implementation of MLflow to track experiments, compare different models, and monitor data drift over time.

Features  

    Model Training: The repository includes scripts and notebooks for training the credit risk scoring model.
    API: A robust API for deploying the model, ensuring scalability and accessibility.
    Streamlit Interface: An intuitive Streamlit app for interacting with the API and visualizing results.
    Model Tracking: MLflow is integrated to track model performance, experiment with different algorithms, and monitor data drift.
